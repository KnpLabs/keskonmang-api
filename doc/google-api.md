# Google API

You have to create a project on the [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/projectcreate).
Then go on to the Credentials [page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and create credentials for:
- **OAuth client ID** -> for dev, add `http://localhost:3001` on Authorized Javascript Origins and add authorized email [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent).
- **API key**
You will be able to have **client ID** and **client secret** on your *OAuth client Id*, and your **API key**.
